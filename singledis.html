	<p><h1><u>SINGLE DISPLACEMENT REACTION</u> </h1></p><br><br>

<p>A single displacement reaction or substitution reaction is a common and important type of chemical reaction. A substitution or single displacement reaction is characterized by one element being displaced from a compound by another element.A single displacement reaction is a specific type of oxidation-reduction reaction. An element or ion is replaced by another in a compound.<br><br>
A + BC â†’ AC + B<br><br>

You can recognize this type of reaction by looking for a trade between one cation or anion in a compound with a pure substance in the reactants side of the equation, forming a new compound in the products side of the reaction.<br><br>

If, however, two compounds appear to "trade partners", then you're looking at a double displacement reaction rather than a single displacement.<br><br></p>

<p><h3>How is the chemical reactivity of metals linked with their position in the electrochemical series?</h3></p>

<p>Chemical reactivity of metals is linked with their relative positions in the activity series. Certain metals have the capacity to displace some metals from the aqueous solutions of their salts.A metal placed higher in the activity series can displace the metal that occupies a lower position from the aqueous solution of its salt. The displacement reaction is not limited to metals only. Even non-metals can take part in these reactions.<br><br>
Examples are halogens. The activity series of halogen is F > Cl > Br > I.<br><br>

<p><h3>CLASSIFICATION OF DISPLACEMENT REACTION</h3></p>
<p><u>(A) Cation Replacement Reaction</u>
<br><br>

In this reaction, one cation replaces another one from its solution. A cation is a positively charged ion or metal. All metal displacement reactions are cation replacement reactions.<br><br>

Let us demonstrate some examples of cation replacement reactions.<br><br>

* If a strip of magnesium metal is placed in copper sulphate solution, the blue colour of copper sulphate disappears and the magnesium metal turns brown as the displaced copper is deposited on it. In the reactivity series, the position of magnesium is above that of copper. So it is more reactive than copper and it would displace copper from copper sulphate solution.<br><br>
 
Mg(s)+CuSO<sub>4</sub>(aq) --> MgSO(aq)<sub>4</sub> + Cu(s)<br><br>

* Also metals like Zn, Al, Pb, Fe, etc., displace Cu from copper salt solution. The chemical reaction can be written as:<br><br>
   
   Zn(s) + CuSO<sub>4</sub>(aq) --> ZnSO<sub>4</sub>(aq) +Cu(s)<br><br>
    
    Pb(s) + CuCl<sub>2</sub>(aq) --> PbCl<sub>2</sub>(aq) +Cu(s)<br><br> 


* Iron displaces lead from the aqueous solution of lead nitrate. <br><br>    

      Fe(s) + Pb((NO)<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(aq) --> Fe((NO)<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(aq) +Pb(s) <br><br>                                                                                                                                                        


* Similarly, metals above hydrogen in the reactivity series displace hydrogen from dilute acids. <br>                             
For example :The metals such as potassium, sodium, lithium, etc. react more vigorously with dilute acids forming metal salts and hydrogen gases. <br><br>  
     
     2Na + 2HCl --> 2NaCl + H<sub>2</sub><br><br> 
      2K + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> --> K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub><br><br> 
</p>

<p><u>(B) Anion Replacement Reactions</u><br><br>
In this reaction, one anion replaces another one from its solution. An anion is a negatively charged ion or non-metal.  For example, more reactive halogen replaces less reactive halogen from its solution.<br><br>

* Chlorine displaces bromine from an aqueous solution of sodium bromide.<br><br>
   
   Cl<sub>2</sub>(g) + 2NaBr(aq) -->2NaCl(aq) +Br<sub>2</sub>(g)<br><br>

* Bromine splaces iodine from potassium iodide solution.<br><br>
Br<sub>2</sub>(g) + 2KI(aq) -->2KBr(aq) +I<sub>2</sub>(g)<br><br>

<p><h3>APPLICATIONS OF SINGLE DISPLACEMENT REACTION</h3></p>
<p> * Thermite Welding : A mixture of Al and Fe2O3 reacts to produce molten iron that is used to join railway rails together.<br><br>
* CADWELD process : A mixture of Al and CuO is used for creating electric joints between Cu and steel.<br><br>
* Steel Making : We can extract iron from its ore (Fe2O3) by heating it with carbon in giant blast furnaces.<br><br>
* Extraction of Metals : Heating a mixture of Cr2O3 and finely divided C produces metallic chromium.<br><br>
* Acid Indigestion : We can relieve the distress when the stomach produces too much HCl by drinking a solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate.<br><br>
