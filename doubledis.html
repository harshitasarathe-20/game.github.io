<p><h1><u>DOUBLE DISPLACEMENT REACTION</u> </h1></p><br><br>
<p>A double displacement reaction is a type of reaction in which two reactants exchange ions to form two new compounds. Double displacement reactions typically result in the formation of a product that is a precipitate.A double displacement reaction is a type of chemical reaction in which the reactant ions exchange places to form new products.
Usually, a double displacement reaction results in precipitate formation.
The chemical bonds between the reactants may be either covalent or ionic.
A double displacement reaction is also called a double replacement reaction, salt metathesis reaction, or double decomposition.<br><br>


Double displacement reactions take the form:<br>
AB + CD → AD + CB<br><br>
The reaction occurs most often between ionic compounds, although technically the bonds formed between the chemical species may be either ionic or covalent in nature. Acids or bases also participate in double displacement reactions. The bonds formed in the product compounds are the same type of bonds as seen in the reactant molecules. Usually, the solvent for this type of reaction is water.</p><br><br>

<p><h3>Examples of Double Displacement Reactions</h3></p>
<p><u>Precipitation Reactions</u> :- <br><br>
Here, two compounds react with each other to form a solid in case the maximum solubility of the solution is reached. <br><br>

Pb(NO3)2 (aq) + 2NaI (aq) ➜ PbI2 (s) + 2NaNO3 (aq) <br><br>
In this reaction, lead nitrate reacts with sodium iodide to form lead iodide and sodium nitrate. Lead iodide is the precipitate in this case.<br><br>

BaCl2 (aq) + CuSO4 (aq) ➜ BaSO4 (s) + CuCl2 (aq)<br><br>
In the case of above reaction, barium chloride reacts with copper sulfate. The resultant consists of two compounds: barium sulfate and copper chloride. Barium sulfate is in the solid form, and, thus, called a precipitate.<br><br>

Na2SO4 (aq) + 2BaCl (aq) ➜ Ba2SO4 (s) + 2Nacl (aq)<br><br>

In this reaction, sodium sulfate reacts with barium chloride. The products formed are barium sulfate and sodium chloride. Barium sulfate is in the solid state.<br><br><br><br>
<u>Neutralization Reactions</u><br><br>
When an acid reacts with a base, the resulting product is salt and water. This reaction is called neutralization reaction.<br><br>

MgS (s) + 2HCI (aq) ➜ MgCl2 (s) + H2S (g)<br><br>

In the above reaction, sulfur from magnesium sulfide replaces chlorine from hydrochloric acid. The resulting compounds formed are magnesium chloride and hydrogen sulfide.<br><br>

NaOH (aq) + HCl (aq) ➜ NaCl (aq) + H2O (aq)<br><br>

Consider the reaction above in which sodium hydroxide reacts with hydrochloric acid. The resulting products are sodium chloride and water. This is a special type of a reaction because both the reactants are corrosive, whereas the products are non-corrosive.<br><br><br><br>

<u>Reactions Forming Gaseous Product</u><br><br>
The reaction in which a salt reacts with an acid, the resulting product is in the gaseous form.<br><br>

Na2CO3 (aq) + 2 HCl (aq) ➜ 2NaCl (aq) + H2O (l) + CO2 (g)<br><br>

In this case, sodium carbonate reacts with hydrochloric acid. The resulting compounds produced are sodium chloride, water, and carbon dioxide (which is a gas).<br><br>

NH4OH (aq) ➜ NH3 (g) + H2O (l)<br><br>

In this reaction, two hydrogen atoms react with an oxygen atom to form a water molecule. The remaining molecules of ammonium hydroxide are given out as ammonia, which is a gas.<br><br>

Na2S (aq) + 2 HCl (aq) ➜ H2S (g) + 2NaCl (aq) <br><br>


In the above reaction, sodium sulfide reacts with hydrochloric acid. The resulting products are hydrogen sulfide gas and sodium chloride.<br><br>

A simple real-life example of this concept can be of a dance party. People switch to a new dancing partner after some time during the party. Similarly, in this type of reaction, anions and cations of two reacting compounds exchange their places after the reaction happens. To summarize the concept of a double displacement reaction briefly, it can be said that two compounds exchange their component elements to form two new compounds.</p>
