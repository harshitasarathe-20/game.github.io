            <h2>What is a Chemical Reaction? </h2>
            <p>
                Chemical Reaction: The transformation of chemical substance into another chemical substance is known as Chemical
                Reaction. For example: Rusting of iron, the setting of milk into curd, digestion of food, respiration, etc.</br></br>
                
                In a chemical reaction, a new substance is formed which is completely different in properties from the original
                substance, so in a chemical reaction, a chemical change takes place.</br>
                Only a rearrangement of atoms takes place in a chemical reaction.</br></br>
                
                The substances which take part in a chemical reaction are called reactants.</br>
                The new substances produced as a result of a chemical reaction are called products.
                
            </br></br>
            Example: The burning of magnesium in the air to form magnesium oxide is an example of a chemical reaction.</br></br></br>
            2Mg(s) + O2(g) △→ 2MgO(s)</br></br>
            Before burning in air, the magnesium ribbon is cleaned by rubbing with sandpaper.</br>
            This is done to remove the protective layer of basic magnesium carbonate from the surface of the magnesium ribbon.
        </br></br></p>
        <h3>
            Balanced Chemical Equation:
        </h3>
        <p>
            A balanced chemical equation has the number of atoms of each element equal on both sides.</br></br>
            Example: Zn + H2SO4 → ZnSO4 + H2</br></br>
            In this equation, numbers of zinc, hydrogen and sulphate are equal on both sides, so it is a Balanced Chemical Equation.</br>
            According to the Law of Conservation of Mass, mass can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. To obey
            this law, the total mass of elements present in reactants must be equal to the total mass of elements present in
            products.
        </p>
        <h3>Unbalanced Chemical Equation:</h3>
        <p>
            If the number of atoms of each element in reactants is not equal to the number of atoms of each element present in the
            product, then the chemical equation is called Unbalanced Chemical Equation.</br></br>
            Example: Fe + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2</br></br>
            In this example, a number of atoms of elements are not equal on two sides of the reaction. For example; on the left-hand
            side only one iron atom is present, while three iron atoms are present on the right-hand side. Therefore, it is an
            unbalanced chemical equation.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Balancing a Chemical Equation.</h2>
        <h4>Steps involved in balancing a Chemical Equation:-</h4>
        <p>
            Consider the chemical reaction between magnesium and oxygen to understand the steps involved in balancing a chemical
            equation.</br>
            <h4>Step1:</h4>
            <p>Let us first write the word equation for this reaction.</br></br>
            Magnesium + Oxygen → Magnesium oxide</br></br></p>
            <h4>Step 2:</h4>
            <p>Write the chemical equation for the reaction between magnesium and oxygen.</br></br>
                Mg + O2 → MgO</br></br></p>
            <h4>Step 3:</h4>
            <p>Count the number of times an element is occurring on both LHS and RHS in this equation.</br></br>
            Mg + O2 → MgO</br></br></p>

            <h4>Step 4:</h4>
                
            <p>
                balance a chemical equation, first draw boxes around each formula. Do not change anything inside the boxes while
                balancing the equation.
                Choose a reactant or a product that has the maximum number of atoms in it. In that compound, a select the element which
                has the maximum number of atoms.
                In this equation we shall select MgO i.e.magnesium oxide and the element oxygen in it.</br>
                To balance the oxygen atoms, let us multiply magnesium oxide molecule by 2 on the right-hand side.The equation can now
                be expressed as</p>

            <table style="width: 50%;">
                <tr>
                    <th>Component</th>

                <tr>
                    <td>Magnesium</td>
                    <td>1 * 2 = 2</td>

                    <td>1 * 2 = 2</td>
                    <td>2</td>

            </table>
            </br>
            <p>The balanced equation is</br></br>
            2Mg + O2 → 2MgO</br></br>
            The number of atoms of each element of the reactants = The number of atoms of each element of the products</p>

            <h4>Step 6:</h4>
            <p> Specific conditions on the ArrowThe reaction is carried out in the presence of ‘heat’. On heating, magnesium
            combines with the oxygen present in the air to form magnesium oxide.</p>

            <h4>Step 7:</h4>
            <p>Writing symbols of the Physical state to make a chemical equation more informative, the physical states of the reactants
            and products are mentioned along with their chemical formulae.The gaseous, liquid, aqueous and solid states of the
            reactants and products are represented by the notations (g), (l), (aq) and (s) respectively.</p>
