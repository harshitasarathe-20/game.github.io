	<p><h1><u> DECOMPOSITION REACTION</u> </h1></p><br>
   <p>Chemical decomposition, or chemical breakdown, is the process or effect of simplifying a single chemical entity (normal molecule, reaction intermediate, etc.) into two or more fragments.[1] Chemical decomposition is usually regarded and defined as the exact opposite of chemical synthesis. In short, the chemical reaction in which two or more products are formed from a single reactant is called a decomposition reaction.<br><br>

   The details of a decomposition process are not always well defined but some of the process is understood; much energy is needed to break bonds. Since all decomposition reactions break apart the bonds holding it together in order to produce into its simpler basic parts, the reactions would require some form of this energy in varying degrees. Because of this fundamental rule, it is known that most of these reactions are endothermic although exceptions do exist.<br>

The stability of a chemical compound is eventually limited when exposed to extreme environmental conditions such as heat, radiation, humidity, or the acidity of a solvent. Because of this chemical decomposition is often an undesired chemical reaction. However chemical decomposition is being used in a growing number of ways.<br><br>

   <p><h3>Reaction formula</h3></p>

<p>In the breakdown of a compound into its constituent parts, the generalized reaction for chemical decomposition is:<br>

AB → A + B<br><br>

An example is the electrolysis of water to the gases hydrogen and oxygen:<br><br>

2 H2O(l) → 2 H2(g) + O2(g)<br><br>
</p>


<p><h3>Examples of Decomposition Reaction</h3></p>

<p>Decomposition reactions happen all around us, but we often don’t notice them. Some common examples of decomposition reactions are provided below.<br><br>

➽ The decomposition of carbonic acid in soft drinks, which can be represented by the chemical equation:<br><br>
 H2CO3 → H2O + CO2<br><br>


➽ Potassium chloride decays to form potassium and chlorine.<br><br>

2KCl (s) ➜ 2K (s) + Cl2 (g)<br><br>

➽ Hydrogen peroxide decomposes into water and oxygen.<br><br>

2H2O2 (l) ➜ 2H2O (l) + O2 (g)<br><br>

➽ Copper chloride on decomposition forms copper and chlorine gas.<br><br>

CuCl2 (s) ➜ Cu (s) + Cl2 (g)<br><br>

➽ Calcium carbonate disintegrates into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide.<br><br>

CaCO3 (s) ➜ CaO (S) + CO2 (g)<br><br>

➽ The electrolysis of water to yield hydrogen and oxygen.<br><br><br>

<p><h3>Applications of Decomposition Reactions?</h3></p>

<P>These reactions are widely used in the manufacturing of various products. Electrolysis is a process in which an electrolytic type of decompostion is used. In Chloro -Alkali industries, electrolysis of brine i.e. NaCL is performed for the preparation of Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) and along with caustic, Hydrogen, chlorine are also produced. Here are some of the uses<br><br><br>

1. In chloro-Alkali industries<br><br>
2. To extract metals from ores<br><br></P>
