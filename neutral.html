	<p><h1><u>NEUTRALIZATION REACTION</u></h1></p><br><br>

	<p>A neutralization reaction can be defined as a chemical reaction in which an acid and base quantitatively react together to form a salt and water as products.n chemistry, neutralization or neutralisation (see spelling differences) is a chemical reaction in which acid and a base react quantitatively with each other. In a reaction in water, neutralization results in there being no excess of hydrogen or hydroxide ions present in the solution. The pH of the neutralized solution depends on the acid strength of the reactants.<br><br>

In a neutralization reaction, there is a combination of H+ ions and OH– ions which form water. A neutralisation reaction is generally an acid-base neutralization reaction.The acids that participate in the neutralization reactions can be inorganic acids , such as hydrochloric HCl, which are generally strong, or organic acids , such as formic H-COOH, which are usually weak. On the other hand, the most commonly used bases are inorganic bases , such as sodium hydroxide NaOH and calcium hydroxide Ca (OH) 2 , which is strong.<br><br></p>

<p><h3>Examples of neutralization reaction:-</h3></p><br>

<p>1. Hydrochloric acid HCl with sodium hydroxide NaOH.<br><br>

HCl + NaOH -> NaCl + H 2 O<br><br><br>


2. Hydrochloric acid HCl with potassium hydroxide KOH.<br><br>


HCl + KOH -> KCl + H 2 O <br><br><br>


3. Hydrobromic acid HBr with sodium hydroxide NaOH.<br><br>


HBr + NaOH -> NaBr + H 2 O<br><br><br>


4. Hydrobromic acid HBr with potassium hydroxide KOH.<br><br>


HBr + KOH -> KBr + H 2 O<br><br><br>


5. Sulfuric acid H 2 SO 4 with sodium hydroxide NaOH.<br><br>


H 2 SO 4 + 2NaOH -> Na 2 SO 4 + 2H 2 O<br><br><br>


6. Titration methods using phenolphthalein.<br><br><br><br></p>

<p><h3>Application of Neutralization Reaction</h3></p><br>
<p>1. Titration methods:<br><br>
The method of chemical titration is employed to find unknown concentrations of acids or bases by finding their neutralization point. To find the point where the neutralization happens, we use a pH indicator or pH meter. With the help of simple stoichiometric calculations and knowledge of the volume and molarity of the known quantity, the molarity of the unknown particle can be found out.<br><br><br>

2. Wastewater treatment:<br><br>
Most of the waste that comes in the form of industrial effluents have their fair share of toxicity which will be harmful to our environment. Thus, we need to neutralize their toxicity before they can be thrown out. Based on the application, different chemicals are used. Some common examples are Sodium Bicarbonate, Magnesium Hydroxide, Calcium Oxide, Calcium Carbonate.<br><br><br>

3. Nanomaterial synthesis:<br><br>
To facilitate the chemical reduction of metal precursors, the heat of a neutralization reaction is used.<br><br><br>

4. In our digestive systems:<br><br>
When food is moved between our stomach and intestines, the food needs to be neutralized. But for nutrients to be absorbed through the intestine walls an alkaline environment is required. Antacid bicarbonate is produced to create this favourable condition.<br><br><br>

5. Controlling soil pH:<br><br>
For optimal plant growth in any soil, there are certain conditions which are required. Some examples of materials mixed in the soil to neutralize it from acidity are:<br><br>

* Calcium Carbonate (Limestone)<br><br>
* Calcium Hydroxide(Slaked lime)<br><br><br>
